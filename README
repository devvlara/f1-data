Ferrari F1 2025 Data Engineering Repository
This repository outlines Ferrari's data engineering strategy for the 2025 Formula 1 season. It focuses on the collection and organization of critical data to support data-driven decisions, enhancing team performance with the addition of Lewis Hamilton, the departure of Carlos Sainz, and continued collaboration with Charles Leclerc.
Motivation

F1 Growth: Formula 1 is a rapidly growing sport with increasing global interest.
Engineering Excellence: High-level engineering in F1 relies on data-driven decisions to optimize performance.

Situation
As Ferrari prepares for the 2025 season during the winter break, significant changes have been made:

Lewis Hamilton joins from Mercedes, replacing Carlos Sainz.
The Team Principal is working with the lead data engineer to identify essential data and metrics for collection and organization.
Goal: Leverage data-driven decisions to improve team performance for the upcoming season.

Desired Data
To optimize Ferrari's performance in 2025, the following data and metrics are prioritized:
Lewis Hamilton’s Recent Performance Metrics

Lap Time Consistency: Analyze qualifying and race pace over recent seasons.
Tire Management: Performance across stints and tire compounds.
Telemetry Comparisons: Acceleration, braking, and corner entry/exit speeds across tracks.

Carlos Sainz’s Departing Data

Race-by-Race Telemetry: Identify strengths and weaknesses in Ferrari’s car setup.
Pit Stop and Strategy Logs: Review reliability and operational patterns for optimization.

Comparisons with Charles Leclerc

Driving Style: Compare braking points, mid-corner speeds, and throttle application.
Car Balance Preferences: Analyze oversteer vs. understeer preferences for setup compromises.
Team Dynamics: Review historical on-track interactions between Hamilton and Leclerc.

Car Development & Reliability

Power Unit: Reliability, horsepower, torque, and thermal management for 2024, plus 2025 upgrades.
Aerodynamics: Correlate wind tunnel and on-track performance.
Reliability Logs: Analyze mechanical DNFs, causes, and mitigations.
Upgrade Timelines: Evaluate historical success of mid-season upgrades.

Pit Stop & Strategy Data

Pit Stop Times: Average times and recurring errors.
Strategy Decisions: Analyze early vs. late pit strategies across tracks.
Real-Time Decisions: Assess reactivity vs. conservatism compared to competitors.

Track-Specific Performance

Lap Time Deltas: Compare performance in dry vs. wet conditions.
Circuit Types: Evaluate high-downforce vs. low-downforce circuit performance.
Overtaking: Analyze difficulty and success rates on specific tracks.
Hamilton’s Historical Data: Review his performance on these circuits with Mercedes.

Competitive Benchmarking

Team Comparisons: Compare race pace, qualifying pace, and tire wear with Red Bull, Mercedes, McLaren, Aston Martin, etc.
Sector Breakdowns: Identify deficits and advantages in 2024 sector times.

Data Sources

Kaggle: Formula 1 World Champions 1950-2024: Comprehensive dataset covering races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, and championships.
OpenF1: Real-time data including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more.
