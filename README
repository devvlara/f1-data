## Motivation

- F1 is a fast growing sport
- High Level engineering requires lots of data driven decisions

## Situation

We’re heading into the 2025 season over the winter break at Ferrari, where we’ve just brought Lewis Hamilton on board from Mercedes to replace Carlos Sainz. I, as the Team Principal, am sitting down with you, our lead data engineer, to figure out exactly what information and metrics we need to collect and organize before diving into analysis. The goal is to make data-driven decisions that will enhance team performance for the upcoming year.

## Desired Data

**Lewis Hamilton’s Recent Performance Metrics**

- **Lap time consistency** over the last few seasons (both qualifying and race pace).
- **Tire management data**: how his performance changes over different stints, and under various compound choices.
- **Telemetry comparisons**: acceleration, braking, corner entry/exit speeds across multiple tracks.

**Carlos Sainz’s Departing Data**

- While we won’t be working with him next year, reviewing Sainz’s performance at Ferrari might illuminate any potential car setup issues or development paths we should continue or abandon.
- **Race-by-race telemetry**: see where he excelled or struggled in our car.
- **Pit stop and strategy logs** involving Sainz to see if there were any recurring reliability or operational patterns we can either address or optimize for Hamilton.

**Comparisons with Charles Leclerc**

- We need to analyze synergy between Hamilton’s driving style and Leclerc’s style. That means looking at:
    - **Driving style comparison**: braking points, mid-corner speeds, throttle application.
    - **Preferred car balance**: who likes oversteer vs. understeer, how we might compromise the car setup to suit both.
    - **Team dynamics**: if we have any historical data on how Hamilton and Leclerc interact or overlap on track, that’s valuable (e.g., from past battles).

**Car Development & Reliability**

- **Power unit data**: reliability stats, horsepower output, torque curves, thermal management data for the 2024 season, and any planned upgrades for 2025.
- **Aerodynamic updates**: correlation between wind tunnel and on-track performance data.
- **Reliability logs**: all mechanical DNFs, root causes, and mitigation steps.
- **Upgrade timelines**: historical success rates of mid-season upgrades—did they deliver the expected performance gains?

**Pit Stop & Strategy Data**

- Average pit stop times, any repeated errors or slow stops.
- Strategy decisions across all tracks: how often and in what contexts an early pit vs. late pit was beneficial.
- Analysis of real-time decision-making: were we too reactive or too conservative compared to the competition?

**Track-Specific Performance**

- Lap time deltas for each circuit across various conditions (dry vs. wet).
- High-downforce circuits vs. low-downforce circuits: where our package performed well or poorly.
- Overtaking difficulty or success rates on specific tracks.
- Historical data on how Hamilton has performed on these circuits in the Mercedes.

**Competitive Benchmarking**

- Detailed comparison with Red Bull, Mercedes (Hamilton’s old team), McLaren, Aston Martin, etc. in race pace, qualifying pace, tire wear, etc.
- Sector-by-sector breakdowns from 2024 so we can see where we have the largest deficits or advantages.
